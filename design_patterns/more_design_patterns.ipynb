    "# used to convert a new related interface into ones the client's expect.\n",
    "# using adaptor you won't have to change the client code to add new functionality\n",
    "# eg) add vendor class to existing customer class with similar but NOT the same attributes.\n",

    "# 6) Composite pattern\n",
    "# makes it easy to compose objects in tree structures,\n",
    "# so that clients can handle individual objects and sub trees through a common interface.\n",
